// TestMain hands this package one Postgres instead of one per test.
//
// Fifty-four tests reach a database here, and each of them used to pay for a
// container start and a fresh CREATE TABLE before its first assertion — which is
// most of what the package cost. The `operations` table is the same for all of
// them, so it goes into the template once and every test gets its own clone.
//
// The CAS, SKIP LOCKED and claim proofs are unaffected: their contention is
// between goroutines INSIDE one test, over real rows of that test's own database.
// Nothing in this package reads server-wide state or needs a cluster to itself —
// the one test that needs a non-default session setting
// (idle_in_transaction_session_timeout) sets it on its own pool, from the DSN
// startPostgres returns.
