// Package listfiltergate is the analyser behind `make -C services/<svc>
// audit-list-filter` for the services whose listing surface is a set of pages handed
// to a caller: kacho-compute, kacho-nlb, kacho-vpc and kacho-geo.
//
// # What it asserts
//
// Every LISTING method must hand back only the rows its caller may see, and must say
// HOW that is achieved. "Listing method" means every method whose name begins with
// List — not only the collection RPC called exactly `List`.
//
// Each one carries a declared Shape (Profile.Listings), and the gate verifies the
// evidence that shape implies: a per-object filter reached from the call graph
// (RowFilter), a containing object read and acted on before the page (ParentGate), a
// per-RPC authorization with a non-wildcard scope extractor in the proto (EdgeGate),
// a narrowing by the authenticated caller (SubjectScoped), or a stated reason why
// none applies (ClusterScoped). A listing method with no declaration is a finding;
// a declaration with no method is a finding.
//
// The inverse shape — "enumerate every id the subject may see, then narrow the SQL
// to that set" — is refused explicitly. That enumeration is capped server-side with
// no continuation token, so a tenant's own row silently falls outside the prefix
// and becomes invisible for good. The shape is gone from all three services; the
// gate names it so it cannot come back "as an equivalent".
//
// # Why this parses instead of grepping
//
// The gates this replaced recognised a resource by a MUTABLE LABEL: compute by the
// receiver VARIABLE's name (`func (h *…Handler) List(`), nlb by a file being called
// list.go, vpc by a file being called handler.go. Every one of those is changed by
// a refactor no reviewer would stop — rename the receiver, split a package, rename
// a file — and the resource then left the gate's view entirely: whatever its List
// did afterwards went unjudged while the gate printed OK.
//
// Identification here is by what the declaration IS: a method whose name begins with
// `List`, on the transport TYPE (Profile.ReceiverSuffix).
//
// The PREFIX matters as much as the type. This package matched the name `List`
// exactly until 2026-08, so it saw the collection RPC of each resource and nothing
// else: twenty further listing methods across compute, nlb, vpc and storage — child
// collections and operation histories, every one of them a page handed to a caller —
// were outside its view while it printed OK. The census could not reveal the gap
// either, because it counted RESOURCES: "8 resources" read the same whether those 8
// resources held 8 listing methods or 21. Worse, this package's own suite contained
// a case named "not a resource: ListOperations is a different method", asserting
// that an entirely unnarrowed ListOperations must leave the gate SILENT — the blind
// spot was pinned as correct behaviour, which is why it survived review. The correct
// form was already in the tree, in services/registry/tools/auditlistfilter, which
// has matched by prefix from the start.
//
// Two further properties follow from parsing rather than searching text, and both
// were live defects:
//
//   - comments are not code. A comment naming the filter cannot satisfy the check,
//     and a comment explaining why enumeration is banned cannot trip it. Deleting a
//     call and leaving the sentence that described it is the ordinary shape of a
//     deletion, and text search cannot tell the two apart;
//   - the judgement is scoped to what List actually CALLS, not to the file it sits
//     in. A filter-typed struct field, or a filtered sibling method, must not vouch
//     for a List that dropped its own. This is not hypothetical: compute's gate
//     reported OK for a List with its filter removed, because the token it searched
//     for survived in the handler field's type.
//
// # Census
//
// The gate reports what it examined — files parsed, packages, resources, and the
// LISTING METHODS it judged by name — on every path, and treats "nothing examined"
// as a finding. The method count is there because the resource count was not enough
// to notice the gap above.
//
// # Exclusions
//
// A cluster catalog or an admin-only internal surface — per-object grants
// inapplicable by design, as with compute's machine_type and vpc's addresspool — is
// declared ClusterScoped with a Reason.
//
// This replaced --allow=<resource>, which excluded a whole RESOURCE. That is a wider
// exclusion than anyone writing it intends: excluding addresspool as a cluster
// catalog also excluded its ListAddresses, a method the exclusion was never written
// about. Declarations are per method, so an exclusion can no longer take its
// neighbours with it, and it is a finding once its method is gone.
//
// # Relationship to the other gates of this class
//
// kacho-storage, kacho-registry and kacho-iam own bespoke analysers of the same class
// (services/{storage,registry,iam}/tools/auditlistfilter) and are NOT driven from here.
// Storage asserts more than this package does — its repo adapter must narrow by
// project_id and its use-case must reject an empty projectId — because its layout
// puts both within reach of one walk. Registry's List surface is not project-scoped
// at all (grants live on the registry and the repository; tags are not grantable
// objects), so it declares a per-RPC enforcement shape instead. kacho-iam has the
// widest listing surface in the repository (30 methods) and, until 2026-08, no
// analyser of this class at all.
//
// That every service has one is not left to memory: pkg/listfiltergate/
// coverage_test.go derives the service list from the committed tree and reports a
// service nobody analyses as a FINDING. The set used to be written by hand, in a CI
// loop and in whoever remembered to create a directory, and iam and geo were in
// neither list. What is shared across all of them is the discipline, not the code.

	//
	// # Why derived rather than listed
	//
	// `security.md` refuses "enumerate the universe → filter" by its SUBSTANCE, not
	// by the name of the call that does it: the enumeration has a ceiling and no
	// continuation, so rows past the ceiling become invisible to their own owner at
	// live rights. Two names were banned here — the store's `ListObjects` and another
	// service's `ListAllowedIDs` — and a THIRD form existed the whole time, in iam's
	// own database: a paged verdict resolution over the service's own tables. The
	// gate did not see it, because a name it was never told about is a name it cannot
	// refuse. A fourth would have passed the same way (#651).
	//
	// # The property
	//
	// A verdict is asked ABOUT identifiers the caller already holds: it answers
	// `bool`, `[]bool`, `map[string]bool`. An enumeration PRODUCES the identifiers:
	// its first non-error result is a set of them, `[]string`. That difference is the
	// whole of the security rule — "page → check the page" versus "which objects →
	// intersect" — and it is a fact about the DECLARATION, so the gate reads it
	// instead of being told.
	//
	// Adding a method to a named source therefore extends the ban by itself. That is
	// the point: the next form does not wait for an incident to be noticed.

	// The ban is about how a page is narrowed. A service whose every listing is
	// answered without narrowing (a global catalog, a store query whose enumeration
	// IS the response, a surface that never serves) has no page that could be taken

	//
	// The gate PROVES the premise: if any listing it judges carries a narrowing
	// shape, this entry is a FINDING. So the exemption expires with its subject —
	// the first listing that narrows takes it away — and it cannot be used to
	// silence a service that does narrow.
	//
	// What it does NOT claim, said so nobody reads more into it: not that the

const explanation = `
Every public List<Resource> RPC must read its page from the service's own DB and
then narrow that page to the rows the caller may actually see — a batched
per-object check against kacho-iam (AuthorizeService.BatchCheck, on the same
relation Get enforces). Project scope alone does NOT answer "may this caller see
THESE objects": without the per-object filter every project member sees every row
of the project.

Enumerating all allowed ids (ListAllowedIDs/ListObjects) is not a substitute: that
answer is capped server-side with no continuation token, so a tenant's own rows
fall outside the cap and become invisible.

Every listing method — not only the one called List — declares how its page is
narrowed, in the service's Profile.Listings. A method with no declaration is a
finding, so a new one cannot ship unjudged; a declaration with no method is a
finding, so an exclusion cannot outlive its subject.

A cluster catalog or an admin-only internal surface is declared ClusterScoped
with a reason. That reason lives in the profile, where this gate reads it — not
in a reviewer's memory.
`

// returnsAResponse reports whether any return statement of fn hands back a
// non-nil first result — that is, whether the method can serve a page at all.
//
// This is the evidence behind Shape NeverServes. It is deliberately a property
// of the METHOD's own returns, not of its call graph: a refusal that delegates
// to a helper still has to return that helper's error, and a path that builds a
// response has to name it here.
//
// The two-result shape (response, error) is the only one gRPC unary handlers
// have, so a return with fewer results means the anchor is not a handler and the
// caller should not have declared this shape; that is reported as "serves" so the
// declaration cannot pass on a method the analyser does not understand — silence
// on an unrecognised shape is exactly how a gate stops being one.
