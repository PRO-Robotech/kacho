// enumeration.go — where the enumerate-then-narrow ban comes FROM.
//
// The ban used to be a list of two call names. `security.md` refuses the shape by
// its substance — an enumeration has a ceiling and no continuation, so a tenant's
// own rows fall past the ceiling and go invisible at live rights — and a list of
// names refuses only the instances someone already met. A third form existed in
// iam's own database the whole time and was invisible to the gate for exactly that
// reason (#651).
//
// So the names are DERIVED from a property of the declarations:
//
//	a verdict is asked ABOUT identifiers the caller holds     → bool, []bool, map[string]bool
//	an enumeration PRODUCES the identifiers                   → []string
//
// The profile names the TYPES that answer authorization questions; this file reads
// their method sets and returns the enumerating ones. Adding a method to such a type
// extends the ban without anyone editing a list.
//
// # What this deliberately does NOT do
//
// It does not decide whether a call is "about authorization" by its name, its
// parameters, or the words in its doc comment. All three are naming habits, and the
// gate's own doctrine is that a habit changed by a refactor must not change what the
// gate sees. The authorization surfaces are named ONCE, as declared types, and
// everything else is read off the declaration.
//
// The consequence is stated rather than hidden: matching at the call site is by the
// method NAME, exactly as Profile.Banned already matches, because this analyser
// resolves calls syntactically and does not leave the package it judges. A listing
// that reaches an unrelated method of the same name is therefore a finding too. That
// is the safe direction — it over-reports and never under-reports — but it is a real
// cost, and a service that hits it should say so in its profile rather than widen
// the shape rule until the gate stops meaning anything.
//
// # Two premises, because there are two kinds of source (#684)
//
// iam's sources enumerate TODAY, so a method set that holds no enumerating shape
// means the shape rule stopped matching the tree — a silently empty ban. Every
// consumer service is the other way round: the surface through which it asks the
// authorization question answers verdicts and enumerates NOTHING, and that is the
// entire point of naming it. The ban has to arrive BEFORE the first enumerating
// method, not after the incident that revealed one.
//
// A source therefore declares which of the two it is (SourceRole), and the premise
// that can rot in silence is the one that is checked: a source declared as the
// service's enumeration surface must still hold one. The other direction — a
// verdict surface that starts enumerating — needs no finding, because the ban
// extends by itself and the census says so out loud; making it red as well would
// fire on correct code, and a gate that fires on correct code is a gate somebody
// switches off.
//
// # Where a source is resolved from
//
// A service's own declarations are resolved from Options.Root. The port through
// which consumer services ask kacho-iam is NOT service code — it is shared
// foundation (pkg/…), and it is the shortest path from "narrow this page" to
// "enumerate the universe", because the RPC it fronts is the one that enumerates.
// Such a source declares Shared, and is resolved from the MODULE root, which is
// found by walking up from Options.Root to the directory holding go.mod. A module
// root that cannot be found is a FINDING, never a skipped source.
