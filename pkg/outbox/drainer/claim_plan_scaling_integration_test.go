// Integration test: the partition-head-only CLAIM must stay CONSTANT-cost in
// backlog depth.
//
// # Root cause this locks (throughput inversion of kacho-iam fga_outbox)
//
//	The partition-head-only claim (Config.PartitionColumn) reads
//
//	    SELECT t.id FROM <t> t
//	     WHERE t.sent_at IS NULL AND t.attempt_count < $1
//	       AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM <t> p
//	                        WHERE p.sent_at IS NULL AND p.attempt_count < $1
//	                          AND p.id < t.id AND p.<part> = t.<part>)
//	     ORDER BY t.attempt_count, t.id
//	     FOR UPDATE OF t SKIP LOCKED
//	     LIMIT $2
//
//	The service migration supplied the index for the correlated NOT EXISTS
//	(`((<part>), id) WHERE sent_at IS NULL`) but NOT one for the OUTER ordered
//	scan `ORDER BY (attempt_count, id)` over `WHERE sent_at IS NULL AND
//	attempt_count < $1`. With no index able to produce that order, Postgres never
//	reaches the nested-loop anti-join the partition index was built for: it
//	seq-scans the WHOLE pending backlog, sorts it, and hash-anti-joins it against
//	a second full seq-scan of the same backlog. The partition index is then dead
//	weight and the claim degrades to O(backlog).
//
//	Measured on a live stand (kind, Postgres 16, real fga_outbox rows):
//
//	    backlog   claim (no ordering index)   claim (with ordering index)
//	      5 000               11.7 ms                     0.81 ms
//	     10 000               28.2 ms                     0.66 ms
//	     20 000               61.6 ms                     0.72 ms

//
//	That shape is the throughput INVERSION mechanism, not merely slowness: the
//	deeper the queue, the slower each claim, the slower the drain, the deeper the
//	queue. A producer only marginally faster than the consumer therefore diverges
//	without bound instead of settling at a small standing lag. On the measured
//	e2e run a ~150 rows/s producer against a ~147 rows/s consumer built a 70+
//	second materialization lag — long enough for a first repository create to
//	answer 404 for 64 s while the gateway scope-extractor could not yet resolve
//	it.
//
// # What is asserted (behaviour, not structure)
//
//	The claim's EXECUTION does not scale with backlog depth: rows examined at 8x
//	the depth stay within a small constant factor, and no plan node seq-scans the
//	outbox table. Asserting the plan rather than wall-clock keeps the test
//	deterministic (no timing flake) while still failing on exactly the regression
//	that hurt: a claim whose work grows with the queue it is meant to drain.

// # Why this is a distinct failure from the one above
//
//	The test above measures the plan the planner picks when it KNOWS the backlog.
//	But a queue table is empty almost all of the time, so its last ANALYZE almost
//	always ran on an empty queue and the estimate it carries INTO a burst is
//	`rows=1`. On a one-row estimate a Sort looks free, so any partial index on
//	`sent_at IS NULL` in an order OTHER than the claim's is enough for the planner
//	to choose "unordered pending scan → Sort → Limit". That plan cannot stop early:
//	the Sort must consume the WHOLE pending set, so the anti-join runs once per
//	pending row and the claim becomes O(backlog^2)-ish.
//
//	Measured on the live stand (Postgres 16, kaname.fga_outbox, 8 600 pending)
//	with the extra `(created_at) WHERE sent_at IS NULL` index present: 6 990 ms for
//	ONE claim. With it removed and nothing else changed: 29 ms. The drainer was
//	observed applying exactly one 16-row batch every ~11.5 s for 46 s — 1.4 rows/s
//	— and then jumping to ~600 rows/s the moment autovacuum finally re-analyzed.
//	Revokes queued behind that stall took 30 s on average (49 s worst) to reach
//	внешний потребитель, против 15-секундного бюджета сквозной пробы.
//
// # What is asserted, and why the plan is not executed
//
//	The chosen PLAN SHAPE, via EXPLAIN without ANALYZE. The property under test is
//	"which plan does the planner pick when its statistics say the queue is empty",
//	which is settled at planning time — and the collapsed plan is precisely the one
//	that must not be executed: measured here it ran for over ten minutes on 40 000
//	pending rows before it was killed.
//
//	A `Sort` node is the exact, complete witness. The claim's outer scan must
//	deliver ORDER BY (attempt_count, id); only an index on that order can, so ANY
//	other access path — the (created_at) decoy, a seq scan — forces a Sort. And a
//	Sort must consume its whole input before the LIMIT sees a row, which is what
//	turns "read 16 heads" into "read the entire backlog, once per candidate". So
//	Sort present ⟺ early stop lost ⟺ O(backlog) claim.

// table; GREEN with the two-index set kacho-iam ships.
