// permission_denied_terminal_integration_test.go — a permission denial from the
// owner is TERMINAL, and the observable consequence is that it does not wedge its
// partition.
//
// Repeating an identical request the owner refused on authorization grounds cannot
// start succeeding: the decision is a function of (caller, relation, object), none
// of which a retry changes. Classifying it "transient" therefore does not buy a
// later success — it buys a row that is retried forever, never reaches MaxAttempts
// (markTransientFailure caps attempt_count one below the poison gate on purpose),
// and so stays permanently inside the claim query's blocking set. Every later row
// of that partition is then never claimed.
//
// The cost of that is not a delay, it is a security regression, and it has been
// observed: an nlb register queue in which no row was ever delivered — 198 rows,
// all refused on authorization grounds. Because a partition is keyed per resource,
// the row stuck at the head was a REGISTRATION and the rows behind it included the
// UNREGISTRATION: the resource was deleted while its grant stayed materialized.
// A grant that survives the deletion of what it grants is over-grant.
//
// Poisoning is the safe direction of failure by comparison: the write never
// happened (nothing was granted) and the partition unblocks, while the service's
// periodic redrive replays the poisoned row so a temporary cause still succeeds
// later. Under-granting is fail-closed; the wedge is fail-open.

// Test_PermissionDeniedHead_DoesNotWedgePartition is the behavioural lock. The
// head of a partition is refused on authorization grounds on every attempt; a
// later row of the SAME partition must still be delivered.
//
// It fails by TIMING OUT before the fix: the head is capped below the poison gate
// forever, so the successor is never claimed and its sent_at stays NULL.
