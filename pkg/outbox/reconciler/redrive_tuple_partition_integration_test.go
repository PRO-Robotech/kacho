// The poison backstop must work on the outbox that carries the platform's
// grants and revocations — kacho_iam.fga_outbox — and that queue is NOT
// partitioned on resource_id.
//
// Its ordering key is the full tuple identity (user, relation, object),
// materialised into a `tuple_key` column by iam migration 0067, because the state
// this queue feeds is a SET OF TUPLES: a WRITE and a DELETE conflict only when
// they name the same triple. Two rows that merely share an `object` touch
// different entries and commute.
//
// That set used to live in an external relation engine; since stage S6 it is
// iam's own `kacho_iam.relation_fact`, folded out of this very journal by a
// trigger. The queue, its ordering key and this backstop outlived the consumer
// precisely because the property is about the SHAPE of the state, not about who
// holds it.
//
// Until this file existed the backstop was unreachable for that queue: the revival
// hard-coded `resource_id`, a column the tuple outbox does not have and never
// will. A row poisoned there stayed poisoned for good — and poisoning is only a
// bounded pause in a service that re-drives (see drainer/classify.go). The
// observable that follows is not academic: a refused GRANT is access the owner
// never gets, and a refused REVOKE is access that outlives its withdrawal.
//
// The four cases below are the whole contract of a partitioned revival:
//
//	revive        — a poisoned WRITE with nothing delivered past it reaches the target
//	revive        — a poisoned DELETE likewise (the quiet direction: "still granted"
//	                and "working" look identical from outside)
//	do not revive — a WRITE whose own tuple's DELETE already landed (over-grant)
//	do revive     — a WRITE whose tuple merely SHARES AN OBJECT with a delivered
//	                DELETE (the key is the tuple, not the object — without this the
//	                first "do not revive" would also pass on a key that blocks
//	                everything)
