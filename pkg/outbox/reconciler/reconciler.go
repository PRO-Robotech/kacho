//   - RedrivePoisoned — re-drives poisoned/exhausted rows (sent_at IS NULL AND
//     attempt_count >= MaxAttempts) back to claimable so the drainer retries
//     them (e.g. after the permanent cause was fixed, or it was misclassified).

// Оба сняты (#760). Их предикаты были НЕДОСТИЖИМЫ by construction: сверка брала

// наоборот; при этом намерение пишется в очередь В ТОЙ ЖЕ транзакции, что и сама
// строка ресурса, а ни одна регистрируемая таблица не является дочерней в каскаде.
// Значит «ресурс есть, намерения нет» и «намерение есть, ресурса нет» не
// возникали никогда, и оба прохода были механизмом самоисправления, которого нет.
// Ни один сервис их не звал — за всё время существования.

// Настоящая сверка — с ВЛАДЕЛЬЦЕМ зеркала, а не со своей же очередью — потребует

	// the claim refuses to take a row ahead of a DELIVERABLE predecessor, the
	// revival refuses to raise a row past a DELIVERED successor — and on different
	// keys each half guards a partition the other does not.
	//
	// Two shapes exist in this platform, and they are not interchangeable:
	//
	//   - a register-outbox (`fga_register_outbox` in vpc / compute / nlb / storage /
	//     registry) carries one row per FGA object and keys on RegisterOutboxPartition
	//     ("resource_id");
	//   - iam's `fga_outbox` carries tuple WRITES and DELETES and keys on `tuple_key`,
	//     which since iam migration 0098 renders the GRANT (user, object): one row there
	//     carries a subject's whole relation SET on one object, and a partition has to
	//     cover every row it can be ordered against.

	// SupersededCoverageSQL — an EXTRA condition a delivered successor must satisfy
	// before a poisoned row is treated as void. Empty (the default) keeps the plain
	// rule: any later delivered row of the same partition supersedes.
	//
	// WHEN IT IS REQUIRED. The plain rule is sound only while a partition key implies
	// that two rows touch THE SAME THING. That holds when a row carries one tuple; it
	// stops holding the moment a row carries a SET, because then a successor may have
	// re-determined only part of what the poisoned row named. Voiding it there discards
	// intent nobody re-stated — and in the removal direction that is access outliving
	// its own revoke, which looks exactly like a revoke that worked.
	//
	// The fragment is SQL, evaluated with `s` bound to the delivered successor and `t`
	// to the poisoned row, e.g. "s.payload->'relations' @> t.payload->'relations'". It
	// must express COVERAGE — «the successor re-determined everything this row named» —
	// and nothing else: direction (write vs delete) is deliberately NOT part of the
	// test, because a later delivered row states the desired final state whichever way
	// it points.

	// It is the caller's SQL because only the caller knows its payload shape; the

// # Reviving respects the order of the partition
//
// An intent is NOT revived once a LATER intent for the SAME resource has already
// been delivered — and, where the caller sets Config.SupersededCoverageSQL, only
// when that successor RE-DETERMINED everything the poisoned row named. Without
// that qualifier the rule is sound exactly while one row means one thing: it reads
// «somebody restated this» from «somebody restated something in the same
// partition», which stops being the same statement the moment a row carries a set.
// Reviving past a delivered successor replays an outdated intent
// on top of the current state — and for a register-outbox that is precisely the
// over-grant the partition ordering exists to prevent: the target (kacho-iam's
// resource_mirror) versions only its update branch, deregistration is a hard
// delete that keeps no tombstone, so a replayed registration finds nothing to
// compare against, takes the insert branch and resurrects the mirror row of a
// deleted resource. iam's reconciler is level-triggered off that mirror, so the
// owner tuple is then re-materialised forever — revoked access returns and stays.
//
// The drainer's claim already refuses to take a row ahead of a DELIVERABLE
// same-partition predecessor (drainer Config.PartitionColumn). That guard says
// nothing about rows already delivered, because a delivered row leaves the
// deliverable set — so the backstop has to carry the other half of the same rule
// itself, or it re-opens through repair exactly what the claim closed.
//
// The partition is Config.PartitionColumn — REQUIRED, with no default and no zero
// value, because a knob left unset here would read as "no ordering" and silently
// restore the defect. It must be the SAME column the drainer of this table is
// given: the claim's guard covers deliverable predecessors, this one covers
// delivered successors, and on two different keys each half guards a partition
// the other does not.
//
// One shape is live today. A register-outbox writes one row per object of the
// rights model and stamps RegisterOutboxPartition ("resource_id") with that
// object's globally-unique id, so "same partition" is exactly "same target
// object"; that is also the key lockResource and intendedRegistered use, which is
// why a full Reconciler (New) accepts nothing else.
//
// A second shape stood beside it and is worth keeping as the worked example of a
// NARROWER key: iam's `fga_outbox` carried tuple WRITES and DELETES and keyed on
// `tuple_key`, the full (user, relation, object) triple materialised by iam
// migration 0067, because the target's state was a set of tuples and rows that
// merely share an object commute. It took NewRedriveOnly. That journal is no
// longer drained anywhere — its rows are folded into direct facts by a trigger —
// so it neither poisons nor needs a redrive; the key-width rule it illustrates is
// unaffected.
//
// # Two honest limits of this rule
//
// A row with an EMPTY partition key names nothing, so "a later intent for the same
// partition" cannot be established for it. Such rows group together — the drainer's
// claim already groups them the same way and the two must agree — and the
// conservative reading is deliberate: reviving one risks replaying it past a
// delivered intent, which is the defect this guard exists for. The cost is real
// and is NOT merely a delay: one delivered empty-key row parks every earlier
// poisoned empty-key row permanently. No live emitter writes an empty key — on the
// register side this is reachable only for rows predating the column (vpc migration
// 0008 added it without a backfill), and on iam's side migration 0067's NOT VALID
// check makes an incomplete key fail at emit — which is why the report below names
// the rows rather than counting them.
//
// The check is evaluated against ONE statement snapshot, so it is "no delivered
// successor as of this pass", not a serialised guarantee: a successor the drainer
// commits WHILE the statement runs is invisible to it. This narrows the original
// window from "every pass, forever" to "a delivery landing inside one statement",
// and the pass is periodic (minutes) while the statement is milliseconds. Closing
// it fully would mean taking a per-row advisory lock and giving up the set-based
// pass; that trade is not obviously worth it and is written down here rather than
// papered over.
//
// A superseded row stays poisoned: its intent is void, and it keeps its original
// last_error for diagnosis. Note what that means operationally — the row remains
// in the pending set, so it keeps contributing to the table's backlog and
// oldest-pending-age gauges, which will not fall back to zero on their own. That
// is why the report below is a WARN carrying the resource ids and not a bare
// count: the condition needs a human to retire the rows, and an alarm nobody can
// clear stops being an alarm.
//
// Cost: the supersession check is a correlated anti-join over the table, which is
// unindexed for delivered rows (the partition-head index is partial on
// sent_at IS NULL). It runs only for rows in the outer set, i.e. only while
// something is poisoned — an alarm condition in itself — and not at all on a
// healthy queue. A service whose outbox both grows large and poisons routinely
// should add a plain btree on (resource_id, id) to turn it into a lookup.
