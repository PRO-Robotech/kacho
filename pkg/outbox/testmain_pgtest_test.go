// outboxSchema is the same fixed table for every test here, so it is applied once
// into a template and each test gets its own clone. The properties under test —
// Emit's atomicity with the enclosing transaction, and the NOTIFY its trigger
// fires — are per-database: a rollback rolls back the caller's own rows, and a
// NOTIFY reaches only sessions listening in the database it was issued in.
