// Package grpcsrv — acr.go: THE step-up (ACR / MFA-freshness) rule. Single
// implementation, two callers.
//
// The platform enforces the per-RPC catalog `required_acr_min` at TWO points:
//
//   - the public front door — api-gateway `middleware.StepUpGate.Check`
//     (RFC 9470 `401` + `WWW-Authenticate: acr_values`);
//   - the cluster-internal listener — kaname `authzguard.ACRFloor` (:9091,
//     gateway-fronted internal RPCs → `PERMISSION_DENIED` + step-up detail),
//     because the gateway re-dials :9091 and "internal = trusted" is a forbidden
//     assumption.
//
// Both points call EvaluateStepUp below. They do NOT re-derive the rule: neither
// keeps its own ranking table and neither keeps its own machine-principal
// exemption. Divergence is prevented BY CONSTRUCTION (there is one function),
// not by agreement between two copies — a re-introduced local override is caught
// by the verdict-parity guards on both sides (gateway
// stepup_verdict_parity_test.go, iam acr_floor_stepup_parity_test.go), which
// drive each REAL enforcement entrypoint — including the machine branch —
// against this function.
//
// WHY HERE: `gateway/internal/...` and `services/iam/internal/...` cannot import
// each other (Go internal-package rule), so the shared rule has to live under
// pkg/. It belongs in grpcsrv specifically because grpcsrv already owns every
// INPUT of the decision — the ACR ranking (ACRRank/ACRSatisfies), the trusted
// carriers the iam side reads (TrustedACRFromContext / TrustedPrincipalFromContext)
// and the metadata key contract (MDKeyTokenACR / MDKeyPrincipalType). Putting
// the rule anywhere else would split the decision from its own inputs, i.e.
// re-create the very second home this consolidation removes.
//
// ACR ordering (normative):
//
//	"" / "0" (anonymous)  <  "1" (password-only, AAL1)  <
//	"2" (phishing-resistant / MFA, AAL2)  <  "3" (hardware-bound UV passkey, AAL3)
//
// An unknown value ranks 0 (fail-closed). `required==""` (or "0") means NO
// requirement.

// MDKeyTokenACR is the trusted metadata key carrying the validated JWT `acr`
// claim, forwarded by the api-gateway on the mTLS-verified gateway→iam re-dial
// (alongside x-kacho-principal-*). It is read ONLY under the trust invariant
// (see UnaryTrustedPrincipalExtract) — on an unverified peer it is dropped with
// the principal (anti-spoof).

// Arms, in order:
//
//  1. MACHINE-PRINCIPAL EXEMPTION. A service-account principal is exempt from
//     BOTH the acr floor and the MFA-freshness window. This is not a courtesy:
//     a machine has no interactive authentication ceremony and can NEVER present
//     acr ≥ 1 or a fresh auth_time, so gating it on assurance level does not
//     protect the RPC — it makes the RPC permanently unreachable for machines
//     (including the bootstrap-admin service account on the acr-gated
//     credential/grant RPCs). Expressing "machines must not call X" belongs in
//     the authorization MODEL as a relation, not in an assurance floor that no
//     machine can satisfy.
//
//     The exemption lifts ONLY the assurance floor. It grants no permission
//     whatsoever: the per-RPC authorization Check (FGA/ReBAC) runs independently
//     and is untouched, and the machine path carries its own controls
//     (credential lifetime, sender-constrained binding, narrow grant).
//
//     It is NARROW: exactly PrincipalTypeServiceAccount exempts. A `user`, a
//     `system` principal, an empty/absent type (which is also what a caller must
//     pass for an untrusted peer) and any unknown value are NOT exempt.
//
//  2. ACR FLOOR — ACRSatisfies(PresentedACR, RequiredACR).
//
//  3. MFA FRESHNESS — when MFAMaxAge > 0, AuthTime must exist and be within the
//     window.
