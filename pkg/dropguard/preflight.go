// This file is the live half of the package, and it answers a different question
// from the measured runs in measure.go.
//
// A measured run replays the chain into an empty container, so its numbers are facts
// about what OUR migrations seed. A tenant database also holds what tenants wrote,
// and no container can know that — doc.go says so, and vpc's own manifest says it
// again in as many words about a table whose live contents are unbounded.
//
// So the live question is not "does this match the replayed number". It is narrower
// and harder to argue with: WILL THIS DROP DESTROY ROWS, on the database in front of
// us, right now. Any row destroyed on a tenant database is a decision somebody has
// to make, whatever a manifest measured somewhere else.

// Counter counts the rows of one table, or explains why it could not.
//
// It is a function rather than a handle so that the decision logic below can be
// exercised without a database while the only counter that reaches production stays
// [Observe] — see [Counting]. The two error values are part of the contract: a
// caller must be able to tell "there is nothing there" from "I could not look".

// AppliedSet reports whether a migration version has already run on this database.
//
// It returns an error rather than a bare bool because "I could not tell" must not
// collapse into either answer. Guessing "applied" would skip every check — the
// safe-LOOKING result produced by knowing nothing.
type AppliedSet func(version int64) (bool, error)

// GooseApplied reads the applied set from goose's own bookkeeping table.
//
// A version counts as applied when its most recent row says so: goose appends a row
// per transition, so a rolled-back migration has a later row with is_applied false,
// and taking any row rather than the last would report a drop as done when it has
// been undone.
//
// A database with no bookkeeping table at all has applied nothing. That is a
// LEGITIMATE state with two ordinary causes, and neither is a fault:
//
//   - a fresh install, where the chain has not run yet;
//   - a database that PREDATES this chain — created outside it, which is exactly the
//     situation the "absent"-kind declarations in this tree are addressed to.
//
// It errs in the safe direction: every drop becomes pending, so every table gets
// counted. On a fresh install they are all absent and nothing is refused; on a
// pre-chain database whatever is actually there gets counted, which is the point.
//
// THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS FAILING TO REACH THE DATABASE, and the two must never be
// folded together — they look alike (no answer about any version) and mean opposite
// things. The difference is structural rather than a judgement call: a pre-chain
// database ANSWERS the catalogue query with NULL, while an unreachable one makes
// that query fail, and a failed query is returned as an error, never as "nothing
// applied". The same distinction [Observe] draws between an absent table and an
// unreachable server. It is asserted as a pair, not assumed — see the integration
// proof that puts both to the same function and requires different outcomes.

//	table absent    nothing there to destroy. That is an ANSWER read from the
//	                database, not a failure to get one, and it is the ordinary case
//	                on a fresh install where the chain has not built the table yet.
//	                (The replayed guard treats absence as unverified, because there
//	                the table SHOULD exist at version-1. Here it need not.)
//	no bookkeeping  a database with no goose table has applied nothing. LEGITIMATE,
//	                not a fault: it is a fresh install, or a database that PREDATES
//	                this chain — the state the "absent"-kind declarations are aimed
//	                at. Every drop is therefore pending and every table gets counted,
//	                which errs toward more checking, not less. Do not read this as a
//	                failure and do not relax it; see [GooseApplied] for why it cannot
//	                be confused with an unreachable database.
//	cannot count    NOT VERIFIED. An unreachable database is not an empty one, and a
//	                guard that answers "zero" when it never looked reports the safe
//	                answer under exactly the conditions in which it knows nothing.
//	cannot tell     NOT VERIFIED. If the applied set is unreadable we do not know
//	                which drops are still ahead, and assuming "already applied"
//	                would skip every check.
//	beyond target   DEFERRED, and reported as such. A run that stops at 0007 does
//	                not execute the drop in 0011, so counting that table can only
//	                refuse this deploy over rows this deploy leaves alone. Whether
//	                it has already run is not asked and the census does not claim
//	                either way; the run that widens the target answers for it. See

//	                narrowing cannot be used as a bypass.
//
// The window it does not close, stated rather than implied: rows can arrive between
