// Package dropguardtest runs a service's drop guard against a real database.
//
// It lives apart from dropguard so that the library which decides things stays free
// of a dependency on the test runner. What a service needs to adopt the guard is one
// call: the harness replays that service's own migrations into a throwaway Postgres,
// pauses immediately before every drop, counts, and refuses on any disagreement with
// the service's dropguard.json.

	// A chain that drops nothing owes no declarations, so an absent manifest is
	// accepted for such a chain and only for it — the same rule the repo-wide
	// static gate already applies to a service that has never dropped a table.
	ManifestPath string
	// DropsExpected is how many Up-section DROP TABLE statements the CALLER says
	// its chain holds. It is declared here rather than inferred, and that is the
	// whole of its value: it cannot move on its own, so a drop that appeared
	// without it moving is a drop nobody looked at.
	//
	// ZERO IS A LEGITIMATE VALUE, and saying so is the point. This used to be an
	// unstated assumption inside the harness — a chain with no drops was refused
	// outright, on the reasoning that the run would then assert nothing. That
	// reasoning was true of the population the harness was written for, where
	// every caller had drops, and it stopped being true when a service squashed
	// its chain into one primary migration: a consolidated chain is one STATE, and
	// a state has no history of drops to count. The refusal then fired on the
	// correct answer.
	//
	// What the run still asserts at zero is not nothing: the chain replays to head
	// against a real database, the manifest is reconciled against the migrations
	// (so a declaration that outlived its drop is still refused), and this number
	// still ratchets — add a drop and the count moves off zero and goes red.
	//
	// The undeclared zero value is safe in the only direction that matters: a
	// caller who forgets the field declares zero, and a chain that actually drops
	// something goes red rather than quiet.
	DropsExpected int
	// Seed, when set, runs each time the chain reaches a version at which
	// something is about to be counted, and is given the version actually
	// reached. It exists so the guard can be proved to fail on a table that is
	// not empty: the proof injects a row here, and the run must go red naming
	// that table. Nil in the gate itself.
