// Package catalogderive builds a service's in-process authz.RPCMap from the
// per-RPC authorization annotations carried by the proto descriptors already
// linked into its binary.
//
// # Why the map is derived and not written
//
// Two authorization decisions are taken on every public RPC: the api-gateway
// checks the generated permission catalog, and the owning service re-checks its
// own map. Until now the second was written by hand, so the two could name
// different relations on different objects — and then the effective requirement
// was their intersection, which is recorded in no document anyone grants against.
// A whole service could also carry no map at all, in which case the catalog's
// promise about that service was unbacked and no comparison could see it.
//
// Deriving removes the second declaration rather than adding a third checker:
// both artefacts now come from ONE source, the `kacho.iam.authz.v1` method
// options, so "the service asks something else" stops being expressible.
//
// # Why the annotations and not the generated JSON
//
// The catalog JSON is generated FROM these annotations. Reading the JSON at
// service start would need a third embedded copy of it (the gateway and iam each
// carry one), and copies drift. The descriptors are already in the binary: a
// service links the generated stubs for the RPCs it serves, and those stubs carry
// the options verbatim. Deriving from them costs no new asset, and it makes the
// tree-wide comparison "catalog == annotations" a real cross-check of the
// generator rather than a tautology.
//
// # What fails at start rather than at request time
//
// The Go compiler cannot check an annotation: `from_request_field` is a string,
// and a typo in it names a field that does not exist. Derive resolves every field
// descriptor once, when the map is built, so such a row refuses to start the
// process instead of failing the Check of whoever calls that RPC first. The same
// posture covers a proto package that is not linked, a duplicate method key, and
// a method carrying no authorization annotation at all.
